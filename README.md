# URL-DATA-HTML
This set of files captures a URL converts it to 64_base stores it in an SQL database. Then convert the data to an html webpage with the name of your choice. This does not capture the CSS. It was made to be used to capture MySQL queries from the  same site so it uses the css referenced in the header. It will of course capture inline CSS fine.
